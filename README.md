## 6. Challenges

This project encountered several challenges that required innovative problem-solving and adaptability:

- Depth Data: Obtaining accurate depth information was hindered by the camera's limitations, impacting velocity calculations and necessitating alternative methods.
- Real-time Processing: Achieving real-time processing on the Raspberry Pi 4 posed computational challenges, requiring optimizations to balance performance with limited hardware capabilities.
- Camera Calibration: Challenges in obtaining precise calibration values impacted velocity accuracy, prompting iterative refinement of calibration techniques.
- YOLO and RAFT Integration: Seamless integration of YOLO for object detection and RAFT for optical flow involved addressing compatibility issues and aligning diverse method outputs.
- Network Latency: Overcoming network latency during live video streaming demanded optimizations for maintaining synchronization with real-time processing.
- Lighting Conditions: Varied lighting conditions affected video quality, necessitating system adjustments for robustness under different scenarios.
- Model Training: Challenges in RAFT model training on the KITTI dataset included parameter tuning and ensuring generalization across diverse scenarios.
- Multi-car Velocity Calculation: Extending velocity calculations to multiple cars required modifications for tracking and distinguishing between vehicles.
- Hardware Limitations: The Raspberry Pi 4's computational limitations posed ongoing challenges, necessitating efficient algorithm adaptation while maintaining performance standards.

## 7. Future Work

We suggest potential avenues for future work, including implementing a robot tracking system, improving velocity calculations, modifying RAFT, and making it lightweight for real-time output, as in our case after deployment the model was too heavy for the Raspi cam and computations slowed the process, and extending the method for tracking multiple cars.
